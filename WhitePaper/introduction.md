## Seamless & Secure EO Access: An Overview
- Earth Observation (EO) missions produce vast amounts of data, supporting a wide range of stakeholders, including scientists, developers, and decision-makers worldwide.
- Users come from diverse institutions — including research centers, government agencies, and commercial organizations — each requiring access to different datasets and services.
- Managing this diversity of users and datasets requires a robust, unified access framework to ensure security, usability, and efficiency.

## The Modern Dilemma: Why Unified EO Access is Critical 
- Diverse missions, diverse users: Multiple EO missions generate different data collections, leading to complex authorization scenarios.
- Fragmented access control: Currently, authorization is handled locally at the application level, often based on different attributes. 
- Inconsistent user experience: Different datasets and services require different login flows, creating inefficiencies for users.

## The Federated Solution: Authentication & Authorization 

## Purpose & Audience
Federation facilitates collaboration by simplifying interorganizational access to EO data but also brings challenges such as dealing with legal and compliance issues.
